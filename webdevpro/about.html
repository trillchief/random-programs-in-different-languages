      <br />Cowboy Bebop Sessions is a Japanese animated television series that
      centers around a group of bounty hunters in a futuristic, space-western
      setting. The year is 2071 and the place is our Solar System, where various
      planets and moons have been terraformed for human settlement, travel
      between planets is simplified through Astral Gates, and Earth is seen as a
      largely uninhabitable place with frequent meteor showers.<br /><br /><br /><br />

        alt="Jupiter Jazz Club"

      />

      <br />The show's title is a reference to both the Cowboy lifestyle of the
      American Wild West, and Bebop, an American jazz movement from the early to
      mid 20th century. As such, many elements of the show are influenced by the
      Old West, such as the bounty system of allowing civilians to make a living
      off capturing criminals, and the show's music has strong jazz
      influences.<br /><br /><br /><br />

      />

      <br />This anime primarily contains procedural drama, in which the plot is
      introduced and resolved during the same episode. Many episodes revolve
      around a particular bounty head the Bebop crew connect to in some way. For
      example, in Session 23 Brain Scratch the crew actively try to capture a
      known criminal for only that episode.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        align="right"
        alt="Having lost her memory Fay goes in search of her old childhood home"
      />
      <br />Story arcs are also formed and overlain throughout the series. Spike
      Spiegel, Jet Black, and Faye Valentine all encounter people from their own
      mysterious pasts. Several episodes focus on one main character and their
      personal issues. For example, in Session 24 Hard Luck Woman Faye goes in
      search of her childhood instead of a bounty.<br /><br /><br /><br />
